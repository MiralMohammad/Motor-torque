# 🔩 Torque Calculation Project

# First Part of The Task:
This project demonstrates how to calculate torque based on given forces and distances.
---
Each motor is connected to a segment of known length, and the same weight (1 kg) is applied at the end of each segment.

## ⚙️ Torque Values

| Motor   | Distance (m)               | Torque (N·m) |
|---------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Motor 1 | 4                    | 0.04*1Kg = 4 Kg·cm         |
| Motor 2 | 4 + 10 = 14         | 0.14*1Kg = 14 Kg·cm         |
| Motor 3 | 4 + 10 + 15 = 29    | 0.29*1Kg = 29 Kg·cm         |
