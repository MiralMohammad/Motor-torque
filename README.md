# 🔩 Torque Calculation Project

This project demonstrates how to calculate torque based on given forces and distances.
---
Each motor is connected to a segment of known length, and the same weight (1 kg) is applied at the end of each segment.

> **Note:** The original distances were given in **centimeters**, and I converted them to **meters** before performing the calculations.  
> 4 cm = 0.04 m, 10 cm = 0.10 m, 15 cm = 0.15 m

## ⚙️ Torque Values

| Motor   | Distance (m)               | Torque (N·m) |
|---------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Motor 1 | 0.04                       | 0.04*1N = 0.04 N·m         |
| Motor 2 | 0.04 + 0.10 = 0.14         | 0.14*1N = 0.14 N·m         |
| Motor 3 | 0.04 + 0.10 + 0.15 = 0.29  | 0.29*1N = 0.29 N·m         |
